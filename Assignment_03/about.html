                the present modern world. Now information is considered the key factor for the development of a country. Commerce and industries rely on information for 
                making their production and sales plans. International trade also largely depends on information. Information regarding the demand and supply of certain
                products in different parts of the world may determine the export and import of those products in those areas. The globalization process has progressed
                much further. Now we can identify ourselves as a part of the whole global village. The difference between nations is getting narrower day by day.
                We can use the prospect of this globalization only through information technology.</dd>
